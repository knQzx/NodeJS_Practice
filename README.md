# In this repository I am doing the lessons [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) by Node.js and MongoDB
## Also in this repository there are 2 full-fledged projects that contain Node.js and MongoDB:
## 1. My Blog
### If you want to run "My_Blog_NodeJS_MongoDB", you must create a cluster, and in it a database on the MongoDB website and change the link in the app.js on line 10:
```
10. const dbURI = 'URL MONGODB';
```
### Then you will need to write in the console:
```
nodemon app.js
```
### And you will be able to see the site on localhost:8081
## 2. ToDO List
### If you want to run "ToDO-List_NodeJS_MongoDB", you must create a cluster, and in it a database on the MongoDB website and change the link in the app.js on line 9:
```
9. const dbURI = 'URL MONGODB';
```
### Then you will need to write in the console:
```
nodemon app.js
```
### And you will be able to see the site on localhost:8081
